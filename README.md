Here are my files for the assignment 1 in Advanced Machine Learning class. 
In the first file (Assignment1-DL-QuangLocLam), I show the results of many different models. 
In the second file (Assignment1-DL-BestModel), I include the codes of the best model.
I already knit those two files into HTML format and PDF format.
